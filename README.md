Test 1:  React Lifecycle -> A GitHub username lookup, that is passed a property containing the username to look up.  When the component first mounts, a request is made to look up the username and display the result.  Modify the GithubUserSearch component leveraging your knowledge of the React life cycle to detect when the properties passed to the component change and request the updated username details from GitHub.

 

Test 2: Stateless Components -> A weather displaying component, running as a stateless component that can be easily re-used.  Extend the WeatherDisplay component to display the city inside a HTML element with class of "city", the minimum temperature in a HTML element with the class of "tempMin", the maximum temperature in a HTML element with the class of "tempMax" and the description of the weather conditions inside a HTML element with the class of "description".  Then add  a second city, Cairns.

 

Test 3: Event Handling and Form Validation -> A HTML Form that allows for the server to submit its contents.  Extend the form to add validation rules around the fields,  turn the input fields into controlled components, passing through errors and values and leveraging the onChange and OnBlur events that occur on input fields.  If the form is invalid, we need to add error messages and stop the form from going into a submitted state.   Note: The only validation required is that the fields are not empty strings.

 

* Each test is of equal weight.
